Notes:
======
All the work here is experimental. I assume no responsibility for
any harm that the programs may result in. Use at your own risk!

Note that cr requires a third party package called Beautiful Soup,
a HTML/XML parser. Version must be 3.2.0 or greater. Download from 
http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/. This package is 
needed because in 2011, there is no plain API call to Mondrian
to fetch comments (in order to grep for LGTM).

Installation:
=============
First make sure to add Google Code Review to your Google App domain
(log in to http://www.google.com/a/__MY_DOMAIN__ then go here:
http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=5143210+12982233047309328439
and then click on Add it now).

Afterwards, in bin/cr change your CR_SERVER to your server.
Now you can start using cr!

Things to try:
==============
cd <your own git directory>
cr st   # status
# edit a few files
cr commit -m "This is my first code review." -a
cr mail -r mike
# wait for 'mike' to provide an LGTM
cr finish
